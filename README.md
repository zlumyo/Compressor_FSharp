Compressor_FSharp
=================

Compression library for .NET

The aim of library's creation is gaining some practice in F#... and doing my university's homework ;)

Project compiled with F# 3.0 (VS 2012) but code is backward compatible with F# 2.0 (VS 2010).

COMPRESSION METHODS

1) RLE (Run Length Encoding); // ready to use
2) Huffman;
3) arithmetic coding;
4) LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch).
